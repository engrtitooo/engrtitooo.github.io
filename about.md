## Background
I’m a **Senior Mechanical Engineer** with 18+ years of experience delivering complex projects in the U.S., including transit infrastructure. I apply the same discipline—requirements, safety mindset, lifecycle thinking—to the software I build and the products I ship.

## How I work
- Clear scope and measurable outcomes
- Systems thinking and risk-based decisions
- Build for maintainability and real users
- Prefer practical execution over hype

## Focus areas
- Ethical fintech and financial inclusion
- Product architecture and deployment
- Real-time applications and modern web platforms
