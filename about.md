## Background

I'm a **Senior Mechanical Engineer** with extensive experience delivering complex infrastructure projects across the U.S., including transit systems in Chicago.

My engineering background is rooted in precision, safety-first thinking, and coordinating complex systems across multiple stakeholders and disciplines.

I bring this same discipline to software: **requirements-driven design**, lifecycle awareness, and risk-based decision making.

## How I Work

<div class="values-list">

- **Systems Thinking** — I analyze the whole picture: requirements, constraints, dependencies, and downstream effects before writing code.
- **Risk-Based Design** — Identify what can go wrong early. Build controls and fallbacks into the architecture from day one.
- **Clarity Over Cleverness** — Simple, maintainable solutions. Clear documentation. Code that other engineers can read, extend, and trust.
- **Ship and Iterate** — Working software in production is the measure. Ship early, learn from users, improve continuously.
